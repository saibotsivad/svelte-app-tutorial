# Building an application with Svelte

In the lineup of possible JS frameworks, a newer one has come out recently, and
tickles my fancy: [Svelte](https://svelte.technology/), designed by
the infamous [Rich Harris](https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris), is a
"framework without the framework".

You can read the official [Svelte guide](https://svelte.technology/guide),
but I thought it would be useful to walk you through what a "serious"
web application might look like when made with Svelte.

## What we'll be making

In this tutorial we will build a very basic web app that lets you create
and edit records like a real business-type app would do. We'll build an
animal address book. It's like an address book, but for animals! üêêüê∂ü¶Ñ

## Follow along

Each section of this tutorial is in a sub-folder of this repo. You can
build and view all the different sections like this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saibotsivad/svelte-app-tutorial.git
cd svelte-app-tutorial
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

Then open [http://localhost:8001/](http://localhost:8001/) in your browser.

# 0. Fast introduction to Svelte <small>[demo](./manual/0-intro/)</small>

Much like Rich Harris' other JS contribution, [RactiveJS](http://www.ractivejs.org/),
Svelte promotes the idea that components are written as plain old HTML files.

Here's a very simple component:

```html
<!-- HelloWorld.html -->
<h1>Hello {{name}}!</h1>
```

That's the whole component!

The `{{name}}` is a [mustache](http://mustache.github.io/)-like syntax unique
to Svelte (it has some extra bits of functionality). When the component property
updates, the template will too.

Svelte compiles the component to a JavaScript file. Later in the tutorial
we'll use a build system (like Rollup, Gulp, Grunt, or Browserify). The simplest
way to get started is to use [svelte-cli](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-cli):

```bash
npm install -g svelte-cli
svelte compile --format iife HelloWorld.html > HelloWorld.js
```

> Note: The flag `--format iife` means that we can use the compiled JavaScript
> file in the browser directly. It's handy for this tutorial and when you're
> playing around, but later we will learn how to compile the Svelte components
> into modules and bundle multiple components into a single JavaScript file
> like you would in a real web app.

To use the component, create an `index.html` file that looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Hello World!</title>
</head>
<body>
	<div id="main"></div>
	<script src="HelloWorld.js"></script>
	<script>
		var app = new HelloWorld({
			target: document.getElementById('main'),
			data: {
				name: 'world'
			}
		})
		setTimeout(function() {
			app.set({ name: 'everyone' })
		}, 3000)
	</script>
</body>
</html>
```

If you open this file in your browser (try `open index.html` from the
command line) you'll see the header element render as "Hello world!",
and 5 seconds later change to "Hello everyone!".

###### 0. Section summary [demo](./manual/0-intro/)

Components are written as single HTML files that we compile into
JavaScript files.

We can use those components as composable widgets, without needing
to use a full framework.

# 1. Child Components: Getting started [demo](./manual/1-child/)

Our address book will have two main views: a list of all the animals we
know, and a view for looking at each animal separately. Let's start by
building the list view.

Let's start with a list of entries that looks like this:

```html
<ul>
	<li>Goat: goat@animals.com</li>
	<li>Dog: dog@animals.com</li>
</ul>
```

We want to spice up the list elements, so let's try something like this:

```html
<li>
	<h1>üêê Goat</h1>
	&middot;
	<a href="mailto:goat@animals.com">email</a>
	&middot;
	<a href="https://twitter.com/EverythingGoats">twitter</a>
</li>
```

Let's write that as a Svelte component:

```html
<!-- ListEntry.html -->
<li>
	<h1>{{entry.emoji}} {{entry.name}}</h1>
	{{#if entry.email}}
		&middot;
		<a href="mailto:{{entry.email}}">email</a>
	{{/if}}
	{{#if entry.twitter}}
		&middot;
		<a href="https://twitter.com/{{entry.twitter}}">twitter</a>
	{{/if}}
</li>
```

This component doesn't have any internal "state", it just takes the
properties it's given and displays them. These are the best kind of
components, because they are the easiest to reason about.

The `#if` and `/if` properties are Svelte template syntax markers for
conditionally displaying the content between the curly braces if the
referenced property (in this case if `entry.email` or `entry.twitter`)
exists.

Let's make the parent component, to see how we use child components:

```html
<!-- List.html -->
<ul>
	{{#each animals as animal}}
		<ListEntry entry="{{animal}}" />
	{{/each}}
</ul>

<script>
import ListEntry from './ListEntry.html'

export default {
	components: {
		ListEntry
	}
}
</script>
```

The `#each` and `/each` properties are Svelte template syntax markers
for looping through lists and adding the content between curly braces
for each list entry.

> Note: In addition to the `#each list as item` you can reference
> the entry index using `#each list as item, index` and then use
> the `index` property like a normal variable in the template.

JavaScript code for the component goes inside the `<script>` element,
and you can specify things like: default data, helper functions that
you can use in your component, and more cool things.

The important thing to note is that the `<script>` element needs to
[export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export)
an object as the default export, and you'll need to
[import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)
and list each child component it uses in the exported
`components` object.

> Note: The syntax `{ ListEntry }` is ES6 shorthand
> for `{ ListEntry: ListEntry }`.

For now, this component only needs to specify that the `List`
component uses the `ListEntry` component.

Let's compile all this together, and make sure our app works so far:

```bash
svelte compile --format iife ListEntry.html > ListEntry.js
svelte compile --format iife List.html > List.js
```

> Note: For the early sections of this tutorial, when you compile
> a component it might complain "no name is specified for the
> imported module". This error is fine for now, but later on in this
> tutorial we will make the build smarter so those errors go away.

Then we will make an `index.html` like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Animal Phone Book</title>
	<!--
	IMPORTANT! If you are testing with a server that does not
	set the `charset` of the content type, some browsers will
	not display the emoji correctly. You can overcome this by
	setting the charset as a <meta> tag:
	-->
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>
<body>
	<div id="list"></div>
	<script src="ListEntry.js"></script>
	<script src="List.js"></script>
	<script>
		var list = new List({
			target: document.getElementById('list'),
			data: {
				animals: [{
					name: 'Goat',
					emoji: 'üêê',
					email: 'goat@animal.com',
					twitter: 'EverythingGoats'
				},{
					name: 'Dog',
					emoji: 'üê∂',
					email: 'dog@animal.com',
					twitter: 'dog_rates'
				}]
			}
		})
	</script>
</body>
</html>
```

If you open this in your browser, you should see a page that,
although not very pretty, lists two entries: one for Goat, and
one for Dog.

###### 1. Section summary [demo](./manual/1-child/)

Using components inside other components requires you to specify which
component you're using in the default export of the `<script>` tag, and
passing parameters to a child component is as simple as setting a
named attribute on the HTML element:

```html
<ChildComponent componentProperty="{{parentProperty}}" />

<script>
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent.html'

export default {
	components: { ChildComponent }
}
</script>
```

# 2. Interacting with components [demo](./manual/2-interact/)

Our little app displays data, but we want to be able to add, edit, and
delete animal contacts from our list. Let's think about how to add
animals first.

You can imagine a normal input form that looks like this:

```html
<h1>Add Animal</h1>
<form action="http://site.com/api/add_animal" method="POST">
	<p>
		<label for="animal-name">Name</label>
		<input type="text" name="animal-name">
	</p>
	<p>
		<label for="animal-emoji">Emoji</label>
		<input type="text" name="animal-emoji">
	</p>
	<p>
		<label for="animal-email">Email</label>
		<input type="text" name="animal-email">
	</p>
	<p>
		<label for="animal-twitter">Twitter</label>
		<input type="text" name="animal-twitter">
	</p>
	<button type="submit">Create Animal</button>
</form>
```

If we imagine a "form" element (like the one above) as a composed
set of components, we could imagine wanting to *use* that "form"
like so:

```html
<h1>Add Animal</h1>
<FormAddAnimal
	on:submit="saveData(event)"
/>
```

So then we would *write* our "form" component like so:

```html
<!-- FormAddAnimal.html -->
<h1>Add Animal</h1>
<p>
	<label for="animal-name">Name</label>
	<input type="text" name="animal-name" bind:value="animal.name">
</p>
<p>
	<label for="animal-emoji">Emoji</label>
	<input type="text" name="animal-emoji" bind:value="animal.emoji">
</p>
<p>
	<label for="animal-email">Email</label>
	<input type="text" name="animal-email" bind:value="animal.email">
</p>
<p>
	<label for="animal-twitter">Twitter</label>
	<input type="text" name="animal-twitter" bind:value="animal.twitter">
</p>
<button on:click="create(animal)">Create Animal</button>

<script>
const emptyAnimal = () => ({
	name: '',
	emoji: '',
	email: '',
	twitter: ''
})
export default {
	data() {
		return {
			animal: emptyAnimal()
		}
	},
	methods: {
		create(animal) {
			this.fire('submit', animal)
			this.set({ animal: emptyAnimal() })
		}
	}
}
</script>
```

* We use `bind:value` so that changing the `<input>` text will
	update our bound value.
* We need to set our default values to empty strings or they
	will appear as `undefined`. (Try removing one.)
* The syntax `create(animal)` means that clicking the button
	will call the function in the `methods` object.
* The `this.fire('submit', animal)` means that the *component*
	will emit an event named `submit`, with the value being
	the bound values.
* After we fire off the event, we'll clear out the form. (The
	`emptyAnimal` is a function so that it's never modified.)

Let's add this to our `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Animal Phone Book</title>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>
<body>
	<div id="list"></div>
	<div id="add"></div>
	<script src="FormAddAnimal.js"></script>
	<script src="ListEntry.js"></script>
	<script src="List.js"></script>
	<script>
		var list = new List({
			target: document.getElementById('list'),
			data: {
				animals: [{
					name: 'Goat',
					emoji: 'üêê',
					email: 'goat@animal.com',
					twitter: 'EverythingGoats'
				},{
					name: 'Dog',
					emoji: 'üê∂',
					email: 'dog@animal.com',
					twitter: 'dog_rates'
				}]
			}
		})
		var addAnimal = new FormAddAnimal({
			target: document.getElementById('add')
		})
		addAnimal.on('submit', function(animal) {
			var animals = list.get('animals')
			animals.push(animal)
			list.set({ animals })
		})
	</script>
</body>
</html>
```

Here we have added *two* components to our main page. The
`addAnimal` variable acts as an event emitter, and when the
component fires the `submit` event we get the current list
of animals and add to it.

If you check out the [demo](./manual/2-interact/) at this point,
you can enter a name, email, twitter handle, and emoji for your
new animal. (On Mac, try the `control+command+space` shortcut to
bring up an emoji picker.)

###### 2. Section summary [demo](./manual/2-interact/)

Components can fire and handle events. This is the primary
way of passing data between components.

Methods have access to `this` and can modify the component data.

```html
<!-- MyComponent.html -->
<button on:click="fire('something', 3)">fire</button>
<!-- Consumer.html -->
<MyComponent on:something="stuff(event)" />
<script>
export default {
	methods: {
		stuff(number) {
			// number === 3
		}
	}
}
</script>
```

# 3. Testing components [demo](./manual/3-testing/)

Since we've figured out how our components should interact, we
have behaviour that should be tested. The tests serve as solid
proof that our component does what we think, and they serve also
as a concrete assertion of the component API.

Our tests will assert that when the button is clicked, the
component will emit an object with the form fields.

Right away this should raise questions in your head:

* What happens *after* you click submit? Should the form stay
	filled out, or should it reset?
* What happens if you click submit and nothing is filled out?
	Should it still fire an event?
* Should the emitted `animal` object contain *all* properties,
	so some will be empty strings? Or should the `animal` object
	only contain the properties with data?

The great thing about writing good tests is that you can make
those decisions and assertions and, if you ever decide to change
your mind, it will be clear that you did it intentionally, and
that you didn't accidentally break something.

> Lower the friction of writing tests as much as possible.

We want it to be as easy as possible to write tests, **and** as
easy as possible to reference tests. In this tutorial I've written
tests using [tape](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tape), and placed
the test files next to the component files, with the extension
`*.spec.js` to make it easier to find them.

To start with, we will make a test file for `FormAddAnimal.html`
and simply assert that the component can be created without throwing
any errors:

```js
const test = require('tape')
const FormAddAnimal = require('./FormAddAnimal.html')

test('creating the component does not throw error', t => {
	const component = new FormAddAnimal()
	t.end()
})
```

You should note that `require('./FormAddAnimal.html')` will fail,
because NodeJS cannot natively require HTML files. In order to
make the component tests work, we will need to first compile the
HTML component files into JavaScript.

The easiest way I have found is to use a combination of

* [browserify](http://browserify.org/) Bundling/build tool
* [sveltify](https://github.com/TehShrike/sveltify) Browserify plugin for Svelte
* [tape-run](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tape-run) Run tests in a headless browser

After all those are installed, the command to run them together is:

```bash
browserify -t [ sveltify ] FormAddAnimal.spec.js | tape-run
```

This does the following:

* Input the `FormAddAnimal.spec.js` file to `browserify`
* Use the `sveltify` transform (`-t`) which will handle the
	`require` of HTML files and compile them first
* Pipe the output JS bundled file to `tape-run`, which uses
	the electron browser in headless mode by default

After you've confirmed that to be working, we can add another
test to the same file:

```js
test('modified input values in fired event', t => {
	// attach the component to <body>
	const component = new FormAddAnimal({
		target: window.document.querySelector('body'),
		// set the form values
		data: {
			animal: {
				name: 'Bob',
				emoji: 'ü¶Ñ'
			}
		}
	})

	// test the value of the fired event
	component.on('submit', animal => {
		t.equal(animal.name, 'Bob', 'name should be emitted')
		t.equal(animal.emoji, 'ü¶Ñ', 'emoji should be emitted')
		t.notOk(animal.email, 'email should not exist')
		t.notOk(animal.twitter, 'twitter should not exist')
		// complete the test
		t.end()
	})

	// simulate clicking the button
	const click = new window.MouseEvent('click')
	window.document.querySelector('button').dispatchEvent(click)
})
```

Another way to write tests is to write your component so
it uses [computed properties](https://svelte.technology/guide#computed-properties)
instead of putting the logic in your template. Then you can
test the computed property instead of testing your template,
and that is usually an easier test to read:

```html
<!-- Example.html -->
{{#if someValue}}
<p>This displays if `calories` is greater than 5.</p>
{{/if}}
<script>
export default {
	computed: {
		someValue(calories) {
			return calories > 5
		}
	}
}
</script>
```

Then your test could simply be:

```js
const test = require('tape')
const FormAddAnimal = require('./FormAddAnimal.html')

test('computed value is true when over 5', t => {
	const component = new FormAddAnimal({
		data: { calories: 20 }
	})
	t.ok(component.get('someValue'), 'should be truthy')
	t.end()
})
```

The same is true for using methods in your component, instead
of making complex templates.

> Avoid logic in the template section of your component
> where possible. Prefer computed properties and methods.

###### 3. Section summary [demo](./manual/3-testing/)

Since you can interact with a component using public
methods, testing components is as simple or complex as
you want to make it.

You'll get plenty of mileage off simple `tape` tests,
using browserify and sveltify, especially if you can put
your logic into computed properties or methods.

```html
<!-- MyComponent.html -->
<button on:click="fire('something', 3)">fire</button>
```

```js
// MyComponent.spec.js
const test = require('tape')
const MyComponent = require('./MyComponent.html')

test('create component', t => {
	const component = new MyComponent()
	t.end()
})
```

```bash
browserify -t [ sveltify ] MyComponent.spec.js | tape-run
```
